## Chapter 1 The Central Concepts of Economics

- **Economics** is the study of how societies use scarce resources to produce valuable goods and services and distribute them among different individuals.

- **Scarcity** and **Efficiency**

  Economic efficiency requires that an economy produce the highest combination of quantity and quality of goods and services given its technology and scarce resources. An economy is producing efficiently when no individualâ€™s economic welfare can be improved unless someone else is made worse off.
  
  The essence of economics is to acknowledge the reality of scarcity and then figure out how to organize society in a way which produces the most efficient use of resources.
  
- The logic of economics
  
  Three common fallacies:
  1. The post hoc fallacy
  2. Failure to hold other things constant
  3. The fallacy of composition

- Society must strive to combine the discipline of the marketplace with the compassion of social programs. By using cool heads to inform warm hearts, economic science can do its part in finding the appropriate balance for an efficient, prosperous, and just society.
- Every society must have a way of determining **wha** commodities are produced, **how** these goods are made, and for **whom** they are produced.
