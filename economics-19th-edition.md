## Chapter 1 The Central Concepts of Economics

- **Economics** is the study of how societies use scarce resources to produce valuable goods and services and distribute them among different individuals.

- **Scarcity** and **Efficiency**

  Economic efficiency requires that an economy produce the highest combination of quantity and quality of goods and services given its technology and scarce resources. An economy is producing efficiently when no individualâ€™s economic welfare can be improved unless someone else is made worse off.
